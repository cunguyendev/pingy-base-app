## Getting Started

Step by step to run this app in your local

### Install packages

At your directory root, run:

```
npm/yarn install
```

### Run server

```
npm/yarn start
```

Open on web: http://localhost:4000 (this is by me, you can custom it)

### Build

```
npm/yarn run build
```

_You can update the source structures to follow your patterns._

_Note: Live-reload is supported_

_Coming soon: A non-interactive version of the init command. In the mean-time, it's worth noting that you can actually initialise a Pingy project by simply running the command touch .pingy.json._
